This is the first in a five part series centered around the [[https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/][Learning How To
Learn]] course, available as a free MOOC on Coursera. I've always been interested
in how to optimise the learning process; the Data Science profession is built on
very quickly shifting sands, so staying up to date with the latest advancements
in the field is highly important for any professional working in the space.
There will be four posts (synthesizing the learning from each week of the
course), along with a final shorter post that reviews the course as a whole.

I first saw recommendations for the course on Hacker News; the timing was
serendipitous as it fell in with a particularly quiet period at work, during the
2019 UK General Election. Purdah rules come into effect, which has two effects:

1. Publication of work is forbidden as it may influence the election outcome.
   Thus, many analytical products become "frozen in time".
2. The ensuing uncertainty after an election period can completely shake up the
   large projects going on at a department.

Thus, Civil Servants often use the time to catch up on their professional
development, reach out to other departments, and start new schemes. I elected to
use some of the time to complete the Learning How To Learn course, amongst other
more technically-focused learning activities.

These notes were generated from notes written by hand during the course. They
are not purely notes from the course - there are some additional notes /
connections I've made based on my own experiences and other readings in relevant
subject areas. They're not too touched up, so forgive any stylistic shifts or
typos!

Course Authors:
- Dr Barbara Oakley
- Dr Terrence Sejnowski

*** Focused & Diffused Learning
- The course is accompanied by A Mind for Numbers, by Dr Barbara Oakley
- Core to the course is the idea of two modes of Learning:
  - Focused Mode (attention on one thing, intentional, neurons firing in close proximity)
  - Diffuse Mode (unfocused learning mode, unintentional, strenghtening of
    neurons spread out over a wider area, connections made with existing neural connections)
- Going back and forth between these two modes is what enables us to learn;
    both are vital for the process. Growing Neurons and connecting/strengthening
    them is key to the learning process.
- Focused Mode is best for learning new things that are complex.
- Diffuse Mode is best for drawing connections between ideas and concepts based
  on a neural pathway you've already developed by learning in Focused Mode.
- It's vital to allow for enough time for learning new things, especially if the
  subject matter is difficult, because learning things too quickly (cramming)
  causes a jumble of learned information that can't be effectively sorted
  through when called upon organically (although, from experience, it can be
  good for rote memorisation of methods). Crammed information can't be
  effectively called upon in domain-invariant ways, which leads to inability to
  generalise learning experiences from one application to another.
- This learning schism (marathon vs sprint) can be likened to muscle
  development; it takes a lot of time and continuous progressive strain to build
  muscle mass efficiently and sustainably. The brain happens to work in the same
  way, it's just less intuitive because muscle is tangible, learning is not.

  [[./images/Learning/LearningHowToLearn/FocusedVsDiffuse.png]]

  The above screenshot shows the difference between neuron interactions in
  Focused and Diffused Mode. Focused Mode clusters neurons close together, like
  a pinball machine with innumerable close-knit bumpers, so trains of thought
  activate multiple "bumpers" in close proximity. Diffused mode spaces neurons
  out further apart from one another; trains of thought bounce across wide areas
  in the brain, connecting neurons in different areas together.

*** Procrastination, Memory & Sleep
- The author hated Maths & Science as a child, but this was changed as she got older.
- Key to this was her tendency to always procrastinate with anything Maths
  related. The procrastination process is started when people have a task
  that's making them anxious/unhappy lingering over them. When this happens, the
  brain tries to rectify the problem by shifting focus and distracting the
  person to something easy, like browsing Twitter/Reddit. Junk Food for the brain.
- The Pomodoro Method (25 minutes focused / 5 minutes rest) helps break the
  brain out of this cycle because of the small chunks of focused learning, which
  happens to be around the amount of time in which we can remain completely in
  Focused Mode without performance loss. Then, the 5 minute chunk allows the
  Diffuse Mode to take over and solidify the learned material.
**** Memory
- There are two types of Memory:
  - Long Term Memory (like a warehouse, sometimes slow to search, less specific,
    but absolutely massive)
  - Working Memory (approximately 4 chunks of information can be cotained within
    it, like a blackboard with limited space & disappearing chalk).
- To get information from working to long term memory, repetition is required
  over time.
- This is how Spaced Repetition works; it's the most efficient way to move
  chunks of information from working to long term memory.
- Trying to cram information without leaving adequate time / diffusion mode
  learning is a bit like trying to lay bricks before the mortar is dry - the
  information will end up cluttered, messy, and fragile.
**** Sleep
- Sleep is vital for learning because it clears out blockers for learning in the
  form of melatonin/cortisol imbalances in the brain. It also acts a session
  during which the brain can sort through its Working/Short Term memory cache
  and clear out unnecessary information. It replays practiced material through
  the mind, strengthening the most important neuronal connections, while
  clipping unnecessary ones. These different processes happen during different
  stages of sleep (see Why We Sleep by Dr Matthew Walker, very interesting book
  if a bit prone to overlabouring the point).
*** Interview with Dr Terrence Sejnowski
Terrence is one of the world's leading Neuroscientists. Here are some tips from
him regarding his learning process.

1. Boring stuff will always be boring, but you should be concerned if the
   subject matter is interesting but you're not engaging. If it's a problem with
   the delivery, you can ask a question and it will help refocus things.
2. Physical Activity is the most optimal Diffuse Learning Mode activator,
   because it causes the brain to grow new neurons and increases their
   connectivity.
3. Multitasking isn't actually doing two things at once, it's almost impossible
   to do things truly in tandem. Our brains are serial processor machines.
   Multitasking is more about one's ability to switch contexts, and when in a
   busy, distractive environment it's an important skill to work on.
4. Neurons in the brain's cortex are there from birth, but neurons in the
   Hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for learning and memory, are
   constantly regenerating. The connectivity of new neurons is influenced by the
   environment the person is in; stimulating environments (in terms of being
   around other people, interesting places, etc) can increase neural
   connectivity by a factor of 2.
5. This is why Creative Thinking happens more effectively in the presence of
   others. Interacting with others by bouncing ideas around, challenging one
   another, etc, increases the brain's ability to think creatively on a
   neurophysical level.
6. Persistence and Passion are more sustainable than raw talent when it comes to
   learning things. Learning areas should be picked based on those factors.

This is a second in a five part series on the [[https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/][Learning How To Learn]] course on
Coursera. For context on this series of posts, please see the first post [[#learning-how-to-learn-1][here]].

This week is all about the technique of "chunking"; a technique used to improve
upon one's ability to commit new complex information to memory in a sustainable
way, and improve transfer learning potential for the future.

*** What is Chunking?
- Chunking helps the learning process more efficient; bundling related material
  and concepts into "chunks" enables you to synthesize the material more effectively.
- Think of it like assembling a jigsaw; the bigger picture helps learning stick
  as you develop an understanding of the details and minichunks that make up the "chunk".
- Focused Mode deliberately links chunks together through deliberate learning
  efforts. The Diffuse Mode links together chunks at random to see what sticks.
- By blending bottom-up (small details / facts / techniques / methods) and
  top-down (big picture stuff) learning of a subject area, the resultant chunk
  can then be built upon for future learning of other subject areas using
  /transfer learning/, like a Neural Net!

*** How to Chunk
Chunks begin as small minichunks. Starting small and building around the chunk
while incorporating knowledge of the overall context (the big picture) is what
makes them effective.

The general process for creating new mental learning chunks is as follows. /NB:
Different types of learning require slightly different, but still conceptually
similar methods of chunking/.

1. Make sure you're *fully focused* on the subject matter you're trying to
   learn. Remember the 4 slots in your Working Memory (your RAM)? Having the TV
   on, being in a distractive environment, amongst other things, takes up those
   slots. By not committing your full attention to the learning process, the
   brain won't be able to work at its full capacity to learn the material. It's
   like introducing a RAM bottleneck into your system because you're too busy
   running a resource hungry (and dopamine inducing) program in the background.
2. Understand the basic idea. /Really/ understand it. One common learning
   fallacy is the inability to synthesize information you "understand". Learning
   is asymmetrical and ultimately useless if you require prompting from the
   material to synthesize it. More on this later.
3. Understanding the overall context. This is the point at which the Top-Down
   Learning meets the Bottom-Up Learning, and a chunk becomes fully formed. A
   useful way for gaining context is by skim-reading, going through the section
   headers, or going through a picture walk of the material you're attempting to
   learn (top-down) before getting into the weeds of the detail (bottom-up)

[[./images/Learning/LearningHowToLearn/chunkstobigpicture.png]]

The above picture helps given an idea of how learning the structure of chunks
can help you understand the big picture; from the chunks you've learned you can
piece together the big picture by linking together "person", "wheel", "window",
etc. This is similar to how CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) work.

*** Illusions of Competence
Rereading material you've already read /doesn't work/. It's just a way for us to
make ourselves feel like we're learning, it's an easy shortcut that gives us the
dopamine kick we crave from "understanding" the material as we read it. But this
doesn't give a long-term and useful committal of the material to Long Term
Memory. It means we'll be familiar with the subject matter upon prompting, but
we can't use it spontaneously to link concepts or transfer/build upon that
knowledge elsewhere. /It is not yet chunked/. Instead, minitesting (recalling
information without looking at the material) should be practiced after starting
on new minichunks. This is a great idea because this retrieval process helps
build up those neural links that will make sure that minichunk of information,
and the chunk built from it, remain in memory and useful to the learner.

Similarly, concept maps only really work if you are working at a suitably high
level. It's impossible to build concept maps from the minichunk level, they need
to be built upon and generated into fully formed chunks first before they can be
mapped across. Rereading as part of a spaced repetition system can work, but it
requires a framework and synthesis/retrieval step anyway, so it's not really
rereading.


A final note on illusions of competence; you may not realise it, but your
environment may be aiding in your understanding/recall of learned chunks. You
need to be environment independent when learning new information, otherwise
you'll only be competent in the place you did the original learning! Removing
those environmental queues by synthesizing the information in different
environments is an important part of the chunk forming process.

*** Tips on forming chunks
Learning new chunks requires the use of as many slots in working memory as
possible. This is why it's important for first remove distractions. Once the
information is a fully formed chunk, all that material that your mind was
previously scrambling across your whole brain to develop neural links around
does not require nearly as much neuron activity. The chunk can be attached to
one of the existing slots while learning new things to facilitate transfer
learning. The course uses the analogy of an octopus, deliberately connecting the
slots and their neurons on a meta level. Once the learning is chunked, those
neuronal connections are established already, and the octopus doesn't need to
manually connect them all together again to retrieve the concept they describe.

Making mistakes is an important part of the learning process, which is why
mini-tests and retrieval is so important. It's OK if you can't, but correcting
those mistakes reinforces the budding neural links making up the chunk, so it's
important to do that practice! Combining synthesis with feedback will result in
better formed chunks.

From experience, the first steps towards becoming an expert in any academic
topic is to create conceptual chunks about the main theorems/results/techniques
of the discipline. These mental leaps between the chunks helps unite what may at
first seem like very scattered bits of information by providing meaning and
context.

Lastly, metaphors and analogies work really nicely in the creation of chunks.
Much like mnemonics in language learning; the mnemonic is really useful to help
facilitate the recall of vocabulary, and the successful recall of the word
strengthens the neural link and the chunk is strengthened in memory. It
eventually falls out of relevance as the chunk (in this case, a word) is
sufficiently well-formed. They act as catalysts/jumping off points for the chunk
formation.

*** Seeing the big picture
Motivation is caused by neurons that release dopamine. Drugs cause addiction by
tricking these neurons into firing when under their influence.

The amygdala is the part of the brain in which emotions are regulated. Emotions
are necessary for cognition.

Creativity when linking chunks together (combining them in new and unexpected
ways) requires a library of chunks. One might be surprised to find out how
applicable chunks are to seemingly unrelated subject matter when the brain
connects them in diffuse mode. This is why Bell Labs had their wheel & spoke
structure to simultaneously optimise individuals for deep work and teams for
serendipitous discovery through creative linking of knowledge; this happens on a
micro level in the brain between chunks if one has a suitably large chunk library.

Chunking may initially seem difficult. This is because the brain hasn't gotten
used to the "chunking" process. As the brain gets better at doing it, the chunks
become larger and more abstract, enabling better "big picture" thinking. This
requires the creation of lots of chunks, so it's important to get started with
chunking as soon as possible!

There are two ways to come to solutions; and they lend themselves better to
focused and diffuse modes respectively.

- Sequential Problem Solving
  - Working Step by Step to come up to a solution, works best under focused mode.
- Intuition
  - Allowing the diffuse mode to make links across chunks to intuitively grasp a
    creative solution to a problem.

See the screenshot below for a visual example:

[[./images/Learning/LearningHowToLearn/sequentialvsintuition.png]]

Most new learning and understanding comes about using Intuition, rather than
Sequential Problem Solving. This shows why it's so important to place value in
the diffuse mode of learning!

*** Overlearning & Interleaving
Spinning your wheels learning the same thing over and over again is useless
unless you want to develop automaticity (which you might want to do! Good
example: times tables).

Overlearning can also increase the /illusions of competence/ effect; so it is
recommended that you perform what's called *Deliberate Practice*. Deliberate
Practice is the intentional focus on the hardest material available. It helps
stimulate neuron growth, prevent illusions of competence, and solidify chunks.

One must also be aware of the phenomenon of *Einstellung*. Einstellung is a
neurophysical phenomenon where a neural pathway for a certain task is so
strongly connected that the brain finds it hard to create new solutions. It's
not necessarily an optimisation thing either; the brain's "road most travelled"
may be completely suboptimal or even ineffective, but because the pathway is so
strong it's hard to create new links between those neurons.

How can we avoid the Einstellung effect? You can use *Interleaving*.
Interleaving is where the best quality learning happens; you incorporate
different /already learned/ chunks into the learning experience when mastering
new material. This helps develop multiple alternative approaches to solving
problems. An example is different ways of solving simultaneous equations;
substitution and elimination methods.

Ultimately, just knowing /how/ to solve problems isn't enough when you're
looking to apply chunks. The /when/ is also important, as this enables you to
build flexibility, creativity and generalisation into your application of
learned material. Consider that scientific revolutions are disproportionately
brought about by two groups; young people, and people new to the field. This is
because they are not mired in einstellung.

This week has a dual focus.

Firstly, procrastination is examined. Why do we procrastinate when we want to do
hard tasks? It's not just learning; procrastination affects many different
everyday tasks we know we need to do but may initially be daunting. We go into
the neurological rationale behind procrastination, and learn techniques on how
to avoid it.

Secondly, we learn about memory formation and access. Included are techniques
for building chunks using memory tricks, and how memories work in the brain.
*** Procrastination
It's easier than most people think to avoid procrastination.

The reason most people in this day and age procrastinate is because of our
constant distracted states in the 21st century. We all carry around a device
with infinite possibilities for distraction, and that's just the start. We
procrastinate because, when faced with an undesirable task, our brain wants to
divert away that negativity. It comes up with ideas of alternative things to do,
allows you to be distracted, etc. When the distractive activity happens, the
brain releases dopamine, as most distracting activities do (and are sometimes
optimised for). This creates a vicious cycle through which we become "chronic
procrastinators", as the neural pathway is reinforced. In this way,
procrastination is very similar to addiction.

A useful analogy is to think of the crazy people that used to microdose
themselves with poisons to "build up resistance". Sure enough, they could
stomach a large dose of arsenic/cyanide/what-have-you, but it was wrecking havoc
on their insides and lead to an early death in the long term. Procrastination
won't kill you, but the more procrastinating you do, the more your brain sees it
as a viable alternative to doing the work you actually need to do. Like building
up tolerance to a drug, it can become harder and harder to actually whip your
focus back on willpower alone.

A note on willpower; it's pretty much useless when you try and use it too much.
It should be viewed as a /precious resource/, limited and only to be used in
important situations sparingly. It's very fragile, made even moreso because we
often link our self-esteem to our capacity for willpower. It has its place in
destroying the procrastination habit, when used sparingly. More on that later.

**** The Procrastination Habit
Procrastination is ultimately a habit. We all know how hard to kick they can be.
Habit formation works similarly to chunking; creation of new chunks requires
conscious processing of input data to your brain. Through practice, you go from
processing that data in your conscious mind to your subconscious mind.
Eventually, you don't even consider finer details of whatever chunk you've
created unless you need to; you have a subconscious understanding of the chunk's
subject matter as a whole. Examples include riding a bike, backing out of a
driveway, or executing a maneuver in the martial arts (see Josh Waitzkin's Art
of Learning for an excellent book all about this). Habit formation works in the
same way; initially conscious, leading to subconscious execution without even
thinking about it.

It can be helpful to think of your subconscious mind as your inner "zombie"
army. They don't really process input data deliberately; they rely on ingrained
knowledge through practiced chunking, or habits you've formed over time.

***** Structure of a Habit
There are four stages to a habit.

1. *Cue*: An event that triggers the habit.
2. *Routine*: The response made by your inner zombie in response to the cue.
3. *Reward*: Dopamine-releasing response when the routine is completed.
4. *Belief*: Our mental rationale to keep a habit going; believing it's
   beneficial, or that you're physically unable to kick said habit.

Crucially, habits are perpetuated through the final *Belief* stage of the habit.
We often rationalise our habits. An example of rationale for procrastinating is
"I'll eventually burn out if I don't let my hair down for a minute". How do we
avoid this pattern of thinking?

**** Process vs Product
First of all, don't kick yourself for feeling negative about learning activities
at their outset. Our hunter-gatherer brains work against us here; it's a
perfectly natural human response to tough, brain-intensive tasks. It's not
actually this negativity that triggers the bad habit formation though; it's your
response to it that matters more.

This is where the distinction between Process and Product comes in to things.
The brain triggers negative, procrastination-breeding feelings when confronted
by thoughts of a deliverable; the *product*. Instead, focusing on the *learning
process* will help trigger a much more beneficial mental state for productive
work.

- Process: "I will work for 25 minutes on that important analysis".
- Product: "I need to finish this important analysis for XYZ".

What quote puts you in a more anxious mental state? Focusing on the *process*
is a much more sustainable way to approach challenging activities; not just
learning. This is why the Pomodoro method is so useful; by blending in 25 minute
work periods with 5 minute breaks, and focusing on the process of that work
rather than the product of it, you remain optimally focused /and/ avoid
procrastination. This is how we build better work habits.

The brain also prefers process over product. By overloading our working memory
with thoughts of a large deliverable we can get anxious and procrastinate by
doing simpler work (or no work at all). When focusing on process, we can filter
away distractions more easily because our subconscious brain knows it's time for
work; rather than giving in to the distraction under the rationale that we'll
get "right back to it" after the distraction is complete.

**** Mobilising your inner zombie army: Beating Bad Habits
The *cue* is the first stage of the habit. It's what leads you to generate the
bad habit in the first place, and what triggers the response. For
procrastination, the trigger might be something like a colleague discussion you
can overhear in the kitchen that you want to join, or glancing over a
particularly enticing bookmark to your favourite infotainment platform.

Common cue types are:
- Location
- Time
- Sensory Stimuli (Emotional/Physical)
- Reactions

Now we know what the first stage of a habit is, we can attack our
procrastination at the source; the cue. You can't avoid the cues. We don't live
in sensory deprivation chambers. But we /can/ control our response to the cue.
We can do this by enacting a *plan* when we notice the cue. When noticing a
whatsapp message pop up from your group chat, follow a /plan/ you've determined
to put your phone in your bag for a while instead of opening it up and
responding immediately. By enacting and sticking to plans, you're replacing the
routine part of the habit with something better; starting the process of
building good habits in place of bad ones. It also avoids the willpower issue;
you aren't using willpower to pull your attention away from your zombies
screaming at you to perform the Routine response to the cue, you're just doing a
different Routine response instead.

When things go right, you should reward yourself. This also helps in the setting
of more positive habits. At the end of particularly productive pomodoro
intervals (if you decide to use them), grab a snack to get that surefire
dopamine & serotonin kick. Build up that zombie army in favour of your new
positive work habits. Be the pavlovian dog! After a while, you may enter a
flow-state, where we feel in a positive mood due to breakthroughs you make as
you progress through your learning material (the understanding gained from new
chunk formation is very motivating). This creates a positive feedback loop,
which we always want to maximise our exposure to!

Finally, you need to believe in your new habits. A good tip is to engage with
communities of like-minded individuals who are all motivated to do what you're
doing, whether that's learning, or using a technology, whatever. This belief
replaces your old beliefs in your procrastination habit being unchangeable and
inevitable, even if you're "faking it" at first. It's still neurologically
powerful.

The process for developing good habits is ultimately the same as the process for
reversing bad habits. You just need to overwrite your trigger response to a cue
shared with a bad habit with a good one. This is how we overcome
procrastination. By enacting your plan, rewarding yourself and building
confidence in your better habits, your bad habits are minimised.

**** Juggling Life & Learning

Task lists are /really/ common. But did you know that by setting them at the
very end of a day (before you go to bed), your subconscious mind, your /zombie
army/, processes a lot of the cognitive load you would otherwise have swirling
around your conscious mind in your working memory? Your zombies will help
process that information, in ways that you aren't even aware of, to help you
perform better.

Initially, it's really hard to estimate how long it takes to do something. I
always wondered how people were able to accurately estimate how long it would
take to learn a certain amount of material, or perform a task at the beginning
of my career. As you learn more about a certain problem area, and more generally
as you get older, you get better at estimating how long it takes to complete
things. This is vital for good planning, as it enables you to appropriately plan
time and stop you getting overwhelmed.

Setting a quitting time is just as important as scheduling in learning time. The
reason for this is that you don't just harm your ability to work at your best by
overlearning (see the distinction between cramming and learning over time in
[[#learning-how-to-learn-1][my notes for Week 1]]. By handing the day's material over to your diffuse mode,
you solidify your learning experiences, which is a vital step in creating any
real understanding about a subject, rather than disparate learned facts and methods.

One last tip for this section; how does one /swallow a frog?/ Swallowing the
Frog is the concept of doing the most difficult task on the day's docket first
to minimise cognitive load, dread and procrastination. Don't fool yourself into
thinking that doing busy-work is productive when you have the most pressing/most
difficult/most *undesirable* task still staring you in the face. Swallow the
frog, get it out of the way, be happy.

*** Memory

I'll be straight with you. The human brain /sucks/ for remembering facts,
figures, words, code. I mentioned how the brain didn't really evolve to cope
with distraction very well, because not too long ago an ignored distraction
could get us killed. When was the last time a hungry lion stopped its prey
and asked what year England won the World Cup?

However, our brains are incredible at managing sensory, visual and spatial
information. We store that type of information into memory extremely
efficiently. I often catch myself humming a song I remember from a long time
ago, but I realise I don't remember its name. We can often recognise where we
are based on the look of the landscape around you.

The more senses you are able to hook into things you need to remember, the
stronger the memories of that information will be. This, combined with
repetition, is what facilitates the movement of information from working to
long-term memory. This is also the reason why handwriting, rather than just
visually and audibly processing information, helps solidify learning. All these
lecture notes are adapted from short handwritten notes I make watching the
course videos.

**** What is Long Term Memory?
Long term memory of newly learned material is directed by the hippocampus.
Individuals without a hippocampus in their brain (removed through surgery for
epilepsy for instance) suffer from chronic amnesia. A sense for what this is
like can be gained by watching the film [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144/][Memento, by Christopher Nolan]]. They may
have memories, but they struggle to develop new ones.

Memories are not static objects. They aren't just committed to memory and left
there permanently unchanged. Committal of memories is called *consolidation*.
Every subsequent access of a memory alters it, through a process called
*reconsolidation*. The below image is a schematic map of what this process looks
like. Reconsolidation happens all the time, even through sleep.

[[./images/Learning/LearningHowToLearn/memoryconsolidation.png]]

Neurologically, this may be linked to the presence of *astrocytes* in the brain.
Astrocytes are a type of glial cell, which is a cell type that supports neurons
in the brain. They provide nutrients, maintain ion balance, amongst other
functions. The key finding from postmortem investigation of Einstein's brain,
performed to see what enabled him to think so creatively in such a technical
field, found that he had a significantly elevated astrocyte count compared to
the typical human; aside from that it was a completely normal brain. Further
research shows that transplanted human astrocytes implanted into mice
significantly increased their ability to solve puzzles. Make of that what you
will. The image below shows Astrocytes in green and Neurons in blue.

**** Creating Memories
This section goes into understanding some techniques for creating memories more solidly.

Firstly, note that memories are formed much more strongly when organised into
meaningful groups. It's easier to remember three separate events that happened
on the same date when you group these events in your mind under that date, for
instance.

One memory trick to help facilitate chunk formation and committal of information
into long term memory is the *Mnemonic*. The following mnemonic is for the
Electromagnetic Spectrum:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
*R* oman ~ *M* en ~ *In* vented ~ *V* ery ~ *U* nusual ~ *X* Ray ~ *G* uns
#+END_QUOTE

Radio Wave, Micro Wave, Infrared, Visible Light, Ultraviolet, X-Ray, Gamma Wave
respectively. Imagining a bunch of centurions running around blasting each other
with X-Ray guns is an absurd concept but linking the mnemonic to learn the names
(and wavelength order) of the spectrum is useful when first developing the
chunk, and can be discarded when the information is fully chunked in my mind.

Another technique is the *Memory Palace*. This memory trick works by visualising a
familiar place, and assigning objects like furniture and wallpaper to pieces of
disparate information that you want to group together "artificially". It is
possible to memorise the full order of a deck of cards with just a small bit of
practice using this technique.

Many people turn their noses up at these techniques. A common cause of complaint
is that by creating artificial groupings to commit information to long term
memory, you are not "properly" learning the material, whatever that means.
However, research shows that those who use these techniques:
- Outperform those who don't when tested on the subject matter.
- Form chunks more readily and easily.
- Create big picture templates to generalise chunks from more easily.
- Use the learned material more creatively.

This is why mnemonics are so ubiquitous in language learning. By injecting wild
neural connections through absurd, silly, wacky when forming chunks /right from
the beginning/, you're laying the groundwork for your diffuse mode to more
readily make links to other chunks. Creative neural links are formed. This is
extremely important, as creativity helps you harness information in natural,
spontaneous ways, so your understanding is much /deeper/ than it otherwise would
have been.

*** Summing Up
The key takeaways from this week's learning are as follows:
**** Procrastination
- Procrastination is entirely manageable through the formation of better work habits.
- The first way to do this is to recognise your procrastination cues, which is
  often focusing too hard on the end-goal when embarking on a task. Focusing on
  the process is much healthier for the mind.
- Rewarding yourself during the creation of better habits helps overwrite bad
  habits. Replacing the response to a cue is the key. Belief in your new, better
  habits is the final step to ensure they remain intact.
- Willpower isn't necessary if you make sure that you have a backup plan for
  potential distraction cues. If it must be used, make sure it's used
  /sparingly/ as it's a fragile, finite resource.
- Habit formation is very similar to chunk formation; it's all about committing
  information into long-term memory in ways that you can process subconsciously
  (using your zombie army).
- Ensure your plans and todos are sacrosanct, especially in the early stages of
  overwriting procrastination habits with better work habits. /Eat your frogs/
  by doing the work you dread the most first.
**** Memory
- Memories aren't static. They're neurological objects that are subject to
  change, even when we aren't necessarily aware that we're processing those
  memories. This has positive and negative effects.
- Human memory is not optimised for learning /knowledge-based/ material. It is
  optimised for sensory and spatial knowledge. Employing certain techniques
  (/memory tricks/ like mnemonics and memory palaces) to exploit these helps
  commit information to long term memory more easily.
- Memory tricks aren't to be sniffed at; as they often incorporate additional
  information into the learning of new material, you will understand the
  material on a deeper level and utilise it more creatively once that
  understanding is formed, despite the idea seeming counterintuitive at first.

The final week of the course is mostly centered around developing techniques for
becoming a better learner, as well as providing some specific ideas for how to
optimise for tests (which are irrelevant to me now, but worth keeping in mind
anyway).

*** Top Tips for Improving Learning
**** Physical Exercise
Neurons are not just generated at birth to remain in your brain for all time.
There's a lot more to it; this was the previous dogma, but we know that neurons
are born all the time, at the same time as the strengthening of old neurons.

However, if they aren't used, they die. Can't be taking up any unnecessary
resources after all. However, both *exercise* and *new experiences* sustain
their creation and prolong their life.

It's just generally a good idea...
**** Practice Makes Perfect
Unfortunately, the existence of the /critical period/ for learning is true. The
brain's critical period for language learning is approximately up to the age of
13, for instance. During the /critical period/, neurons are created at an
accelerated rate.

However, don't be discouraged! The passing of the critical period doesn't mean
that you can't learn what you missed! It has recently been proven that those who
missed out on the development of stereo-vision (through blindness in one eye for
instance) in the critical period of 0-24 months can redevelop it later on in
life through *deliberate practice*.

More tips can be found on [[https://brainfacts.org/][BrainFacts]].
*** Learning Techniques & Quirks
**** Regression of Understanding
A certain quirk we face is the /regression of understanding/. We're all familiar
with this; "Why am I worse at this now than I was yesterday?"

Plenty of research has been conducted about this. The evidence seems to suggest
that this situation comes about when our brain is restructuring itself around
the information to enable a deeper understanding of the material; moving chunks,
generating new neuronal links, etc.

When you experience the /regression of understanding/, rest easy; a great step
change in understanding is likely to follow as a result of this mental
restructuring!
**** Metaphors & Analogies
In [[#learning-how-to-learn-3][Week 3]], we discussed how grouping helps solidify memory and
therefore synthesis. It benefits chunk formation.

Metaphors and Analofies are simply constructs to help facilitate a grouping
through similarity. They therefore help with imagination, much like the mnemonic
techniques for chunking discussed in [[#learning-how-to-learn-2][Week 2]] possible with these analogies;
having a /really/ novel analogy paves the way for neuronal links where none have
been formed before, further strengthening capacity for creativity.

After mastery is gained (ie: the chunk is formed), you can happily discard your
metaphor/analogy, or change them around to create even more "out-there"
analogies. Metaphors and Analogies are fantastic for creating versatile chunks
and memories, that don't fall into the Einstellung trap discussed in Week 2;
where you fall into a pattern of thinking that you can't break out of.
**** Impostor Syndrome
Chunking is mostly the same between learning sciences and learning sports. In
both cases, practicing through repetition and application generates chunks. It's
not about listening /really intently at your teacher/; do you get better at Free
Kicks by listening to trigonomic explanations of trajectories and visualising
where to kick the ball? This knowledge has it's place, but it needs to be
applied to become a chunk that you can call upon on your own.

By /visualising why/ you're doing what you're doing, you can slow your decision
making down; your intended application of a chunk is moved from System 1
thinking, which is rapid and instinctive, to System 2 thinking, which is slow
and reasoned.

Here's the problem with "superlearners". They typically have a larger working
memory, and their neuronal links form very quickly. But there are tradeoffs to
this. Einstellung is more of a problem for these people because their working
memory is indeed large, but also rigid; information is held on to tightly. This
means that once it's chunked, it's harder to apply to new situations and use
creatively.

So, if you find it harder to chunk, just remember that your /application/ of a
chunk is likely to be much more flexible and creative than those who committed
the material to memory faster. As we saw earlier in this section, the entire
point of learning is in application... So what side of the tradeoff between
committal and application would you prefer to sit on?

With this in mind, remember that deliberate practice can help elevate you to
stronger chunk creation and deeper understanding of the material. *Impostor
Syndrome* is where we see the capabilities of others and become discouraged.
Hopefully this explanation of how capable learners may face troubles in creative
application will help alleviate it somewhat. Just know that it's incredibly
common, but tradeoffs exist everywhere; that's why diversity is so emphasised in
modern corporate culture. We all bring different skills and perspectives to the
table.
**** The Mental Game
Myelin Sheaths are coatings for neuron links that help transfer signals between
neurons. As teenagers, our myelin sheaths are not fully formed. This is why they
are impulsive; the connections between intention & control systems of the brain
are not fully formed yet.

The formation of myelin sheaths is sped up through usage of those specific
neurons; so there is significant evidence that the brain can be changed by the
way that we *think*.

Diversifying our thinking, and working persistently at learning material in
different ways, from different angles, enables us to form a much better
understanding of the learning material. Therefore, we are able to use those
chunks more creatively.

A technique to help do this is to try and develop a /cool dispassion/ to deal
with detractors and setbacks. Consider this a reasonable, temporary lack of
empathy. We tend to believe by default what most people say, which is harmful
when you have people say things like "you'll never be good at this"; most people
believe in the general goodheartedness of others. Taking pride in what you
succeed in and what you believe you can do can /stabilise/ us, and keep us
focused on a goal we'd otherwise give up on if we give in to setbacks in this way.
**** Teamwork
The Left & Right Hemisphere model for personality is thoroughly debunked. But we
know for a fact that the two sides perform different functions. For example, big
picture and contextual thinking *require* the right hemisphere; performing
"reality checks" is one such function. You can think of it as your mental
devil's advocate.

The Left side of your brain is associated with focused mode thinking on
technical detail. Using just this side of your brain, it is easy to make
incorrect assumptions and mistakes, as questioning yourself and testing your
hypotheses is part of the wider contextual thinking governed by the Right side.

Going back and *checking* work provides the chance for the less dogmatic Right
side to participate in the thinking process. Using just the Left, you can end up
with Tunnel Vision very easily.

This is where teamwork comes in. Working through problems in a group forces that
checking process, helping you catch areas where your own thinking has gone
wrong. It's kind of like an crowdsourced "diffuse mode reality check" process,
to help you draw links between areas you hadn't personally thought of and
correct your thinking when you've made incorrect assumptions. Working in groups
also necessitates communication, and therefore recall of the learning material,
which facilitates the chunk formation process.

...Just don't expect good results if no one is actually working.

*** Testing
This section will be focused on Testing strategies. These aren't just applicable
to Exams, but they can apply to many high-stakes situations, like job
interviews, big presentations, etc; but you may need to adapt some of the advice.

You can also adapt some of these techniques to personally devised "mini tests"
for when you're learning new material. In [[#learning-how-to-learn-1][Weeks 1]] & [[#learning-how-to-learn-2][2]] we discussed how testing
yourself is the strongest process through which you can learn new material.
**** Test Checklist
This checklist was developed by Richard Felder for engineering students, some
are more applicable to a non-uni setting than others. If you can't say "yes" to
every applicable point on this list, you aren't ready.
1. Did you make a serious effort to understand the text?
2. Did you work with peers, at least for checking work?
3. Did you attempt to outline every problem solution?
4. Did you actively participate in group discussions about problems?
5. Did you consult with the instructor when stuck on a particularly hard problem?
6. Did you understand every problem solution?
7. Did you seek out explanations for solutions that you didn't understand?
8. Did you complete a recommended study guide?
9. Did you outline problem solutions _quickly_, without focusing too intently on
   the detail or maths behind that solution?
10. Did you quiz peers on problems & the study guide?
11. Did you participate in revision sessions?
12. Did you sleep properly the night before?

**** The Hard Start - Jump To Easy Technique
Think back to the last time you took an exam. What was your strategy when you
started it? Did you flip to question 1, and start making your way through the
paper? Did you perhaps flick through to see what monstrosities awaited in the
final questions? I bet you didn't start trying to work through the hardest
questions first, though.

Let's consider everything we've learned in this course. Diffuse mode can work
concurrently to Focused mode on other tasks that have been imprinted on working
memory. With this in mind, the most time-efficient way to work through an exam
is to start on the hardest question(s) first, then switch contexts to the easy
questions to work through. This allows your diffuse mode to take over on the
hard problem, let your zombies jump on it and start dismantling it in the
background, while you grind through the easy stuff. Then after at least 5
minutes, switch back to the hard problem, and try working through it a bit more.

This strategy is completely counterintuitive. Starting Hard, then Jumping To
Easy is a strange way of working, but it can really work well for some people.
By leveraging your brain's natural parallel capabilities, you can accomplish
more than if you tackled the problems in order.

It's a bit like working as a chef; handling lots of different things at once
enables you to manage many simultaneous process. Even better than that though is
that by allowing your diffuse mode to work in the background, you're more likely
to be creative with the solutions you eventually do come up with! So even if the
time saving was negligible, you'll do better in the test because you're more
likely to break through the novelty of a never-before-seen question by applying
known methods in creative ways to solve the problem.

However, this process doesn't work for everybody; some people's brains just
aren't predisposed to this kind of working, so don't just rock up into a test
and expect to smash it without testing the method first. Give it a go on a mock
or a timed practice paper, and see how you go.
**** Stress Techniques
Cortisol is a steroid hormone that is released whenever you're feeling stressed.
It's responsible for the sweaty palms and general anxiety felt by stressed
individuals. The release of cortisol doesn't automatically mean that you're
about to decompose into an anxious mess though! Research shows that the "story
you tell yourself about the stress you're experiencing" has more of an effect
on your general mental state than your cortisol levels. This is why positive
mental attitudes are so important!

Keeping that positive mental attitude (and regulating your self-talk so it is
has a more "reinforcing" tone than a destructive one) therefore minimises
anxiety, and wards away our bodies' biological fight-or-flight response to
stress. Deep breathing helps counteract that response as well; do it by trying
to breathe into your belly, not your chest. As always, practice makes perfect;
but *both these techniques implemented deliberately and consistently in response
to stressful situations increase their speed and effectiveness*!
**** Recall
How can you improve your brain's ability to recall information? The best
practice you can do to develop your brain's searching abilities for specific
material is to use multiple choice quizzes, cover the answers and try to answer
the question without the aid of the multiple choice answers. This stimulates
your brain's recall pathways so that when you're faced with the same (or
similar) questions, you have a better chance of successfully recalling the
information.

This is why Anki is so effective. A personal story: I like using Clozemaster to
practice my languages. The core "game loop" is that you fill the gap in a
sentence by picking the right word from a multiple choice list. This is a
"Cloze" card, in spaced repetition learning systems like Anki. You have the
choice to enable multiple choices or not; by enabling multiple choice but
attempting to answer the question mentally without the aid of those choices, I'm
more likely to get the answer right when the question is repeated to me after a
certain time period based on spaced repetition.
**** Rest
You need both your focused and your diffuse modes to be successful in learning
new material; don't run yourself ragged and complain you messed up your exam or
interview. When was the last time someone prepared for a marathon by running a
marathon the day before race day?
**** Face your fears
The final piece of advice is to reduce your stress responses by making a Plan B
in case everything goes to pot. Imagine your absolute worst case scenarios if
you fail this exam, or that interview; what would Plan B be? By facing the fear
of failure in this way and putting in plans to mitigate them we can more easily
wrangle ourselves into the golden "Win Win" pattern of thinking. Getting
yourself into that place means you're at peace with all possible outcomes of an
event. This place is where most people perform at their best.
*** Wrap Up
This week has been a bit more disparate than the previous 3 in terms of its
theme; we've learned less about our mental processes and how we think and more
about how we can apply the knowledge from the other weeks into techniques on
dealing with challenging situations and learning in general.

This post will be followed by a review post, in which I go over the course in
higher level of detail and give my opinions on the MOOC in general. I hope that
these notes help supplement the material from the course, as there really is no
replacement for learning from the experts, and that's certainly what Dr Barbara
Oakley and Dr Terrence Sejnowski are!

** DONE 19 Months on the Civil Service Fast Stream :Civil__Service:
CLOSED: [2019-05-27 Mon 18:00]
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: my-time-on-the-fast-stream
:CUSTOM_ID: my-time-on-the-fast-stream
:EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :type post
:END:

I left the finance systems consultancy world in September 2017, as I had secured
a place on the Civil Service Fast Stream. I figured that, now that I've
"graduated" from the scheme so to speak, I'd put up a post about my experiences
on the scheme.

If you are reading this post-2019 intake, current plans are to change the format
of the fast stream significantly for 2020 onwards. This might not end up
happening, especially since this year has been so politically turbulent with no
end in sight!

*** Operational Research
The term "Operational Researcher" confuses people. It still confuses me. The
profession is not nearly defined as the other analytical professions in the
Civil Service (Economist, Social Researcher and Statistician). Each analytical
profession also has a professional network within the Civil Service, of which
the OR one is the Government Operational Research Service. There's a lot of rich
history that I won't go into here, but at its core, Operational Research is
about applying analytical methods to make better decisions. These techniques
need not necessarily be numerical, they may include softer skills too. Some
techniques include:

- Simulation
- Regression
- Multi-criteria Decision Analysis
- Wargaming
- Constraint Optimization

In my view, Data Science is a related discipline to Operational Research, and
most Operational Research roles have scope for developing Data Science
techniques. This is how I ended up as a Data Scientist; in the Civil Service,
almost everyone with the Data Scientist job title is a Operational Researcher or
a Statistician, and my skills in data engineering landed me quite squarely in
the burgeoning Government Data Science community.

*** My Placements
When I joined the scheme I was placed at the Food Standards Agency in an
Operational Research role, which I quickly adapted into a Data Science role. I
developed visualisation tools for the department, which involved lots of
database automation, frontend development with R (using the =shiny= library),
and automated report writing supporting the FSA's operations and policy
endeavours. While there, I developed the Data Science capability in the
Analytics Unit after initially proving the value it could add.

I then joined the Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy,
where I was promoted out of the Fast Stream after 7 months. There, I focused
more on stakeholder engagement with the increased responsibility of the role,
as well as model building and software engineering skills.

*** The Fast Stream Structure
Most people do not know that there's significant variation in many of the Fast
Streams that the Civil Service offer. So my comments here should be taken as
specifically referring to the *Operational Research* Fast Stream only; as it is
unique from all others.

There are essentially two main types of Fast Stream - centralised and
non-centralised. Centralised Fast Streams are directly administered by the
Cabinet Office, their fast streamers are officially employed by them, and they
do not get a choice as to what their placements are. Their pay and learning
offers are also standardised across the board. Most fast streams are
centralised. Non-centralised fast streamers are employed by the departments at
which they are placed, have non-standardised pay, but in most cases have some
input as to what their placements are.

*** My Experiences
The scheme as a whole certainly had some positives and some negatives. The
Operational Research Fast Stream is one of the most versatile out of all the
Fast Streams; you have full control of your placement length and your
placements. I used this to great effect, moving on from the Food Standards
Agency when I felt that I had learned as much as I could from that placement
(less than the standard 1-1.5 year placement), and moved to a department where I
could continue building on my technical skills while engaging more with policy
colleagues and line managing other Data Scientists.

Another thing I loved about the scheme was the network with other GFSAs (GORS
Fast Stream Analysts). There's a fantastic community of other OR Fast Streamers
I spent a lot of time engaging with, for work stuff and socials too. Lots of my
best friends in government belong in that group, and it can't really be
understated how important it is in your early career to have a strong network of
your peers for support and to socialise with.

However, it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows. Due to its non-centralised
status, the key aspects of being a "fast stream" are largely luck of the draw
for your first placement. Particularly, one's experiences with the following
three aspects of this /development programme/ can be poor compared to other fast
streamers (and wildly inconsistent between placements within the OR fast stream itself):
- Pay
- Learning & Development Opportunities
- Quality of Work
For instance, analysts who ended up at DEFRA (Department for Environment, Food
and Rural Affairs) for their first placement were being paid nearly £10,000 less
than analysts at the Home Office until they moved, purely based on differences
interdepartmental payscales. This is a raw deal for the DEFRA analysts, but
centralised fast streamers are all paid the same wage, and it's significantly
lower than the median pay reward for the Operational Research Fast Stream, so
this variation isn't necessarily a bad thing. Similar disparities in L&D
opportunities and interdepartmental support networks also exist. The quality of
the roles themselves also have pretty wild variation, but this is inevitable
for a fast stream covering such a broad church of a profession like OR.

Ultimately, there isn't that much of a difference between being a main-stream
and fast-stream Operational Researcher, particularly for 1st to 2nd year fast
streamers (at which point many opt to leave for main stream SEO-level roles;
better pay and more responsibility, but no rotation mechanism). The main benefit
I found was the network of other GFSAs, but I was lucky enough to be placed at
the Food Standards Agency as my first placement, which had good pay and
excellent L&D opportunities.

If I was to do it all over again? I'd say I got a lot out of the Fast Stream,
but I wouldn't stay on it for the expected 4 years. I was lucky enough to get
promoted out of the fast stream relatively early; had I stayed on longer than
two years, I'd have definitely looked for SEO-level opportunities, which are
effectively the same jobs as 3rd/4th year fast streamers, but with a
£6,000-10,000 pay increase. This was my experience of the fast stream as it
existed between 2011-e.t.a 2020, so many of these problems might have been
rectified or mitigated by the Fast Stream Transformation programme.

*** Outline :noexport:
**** My Experiences in Particular
**** General Impressions
- Honest impressions of the scheme as a whole
- Operational Research Fast Stream; different from normal fast streams.
- Strengths:
  - Network
  - Community
  - Work opportunities
  - Pride in the discipline and its approach
- Weaknesses:
  - Learning & Development hugely lacking.
  - Ridiculously long recruitment process
  - Pay is drastically different across the board (some cases hugely
    uncompetitive and therefore no talent).
  - Many departments don't have a defined end point to the fast stream. Most
    simply apply, interview for, and get clearance for G7 levels.
- Ultimately not all that different from the deal that the Main Streamers get,
  possibly worse due to the pay differential between HEO and SEO level roles and
  the Fast Stream role.
** TODO On the Issue of Technical Leadership in the Civil Service
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: technical-leadership-civil-service
:CUSTOM_ID: technical-leadership-civil-service
:EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :type post
:END:
This is a post about my main grievance with the Civil Service in the UK. It is
one that is echoed by many others in my position; technical-minded folk who
enjoy management and feel comfortable with high levels of responsibility, but
are forced out of touch with the technical sides of their jobs as they become
more senior. In essence, the problem is as follows:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In the Civil Service, most "cutting edge" analytical work is done by EO-SEO
level staff - who are typically too junior to have the technical skills to
leverage state of the art methods effectively.
#+END_QUOTE

Let's unpack this. First, we need to discuss how the grading structure works.

*** The Civil Service Grade Structure
- Split in two; SCS and CS
*** The Problem
- Built for Policy
- No compensation for technical ability, so huge attrition of people with those
  skills to private sector.
*** The Solution
- 2D Grading Structure; seniority on people scale & technical scale.
- Some progress on this has been observed by certain departments, who give an
  "analytical bonus". Trouble is it only scales based on academic achievement
  and not technical ability. Let's be honest, the two things are vastly
  different. Also far too small; grade jumps typically come with a ~£10,000 pay
  rise, and the highest analytical bonuses that /I've/ seen top out at ~£6,000
  and actually decrease as grade increases.
- The analytical profession networks (GORS, GES, etc) already audit at each
  grade as part of the standard interview process.
-
