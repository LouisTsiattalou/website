Hi! I'm Louis Tsiattalou. I'm a Data Scientist for the British Government. I created this blog to share some of the more interesting stuff I've been up to relating to Data (Science) and Tech.

Mainly this blog is intended to be a quick repo for the cool (to me...!) stuff I've done, mainly data science type work but I'd like to include my many tech-related tinkerings (which are quite numerous when you use Emacs and Linux). Time will tell whether this gets the attention I intend to give it at the time of writing. We shall see.

Take a look at the sidebar for contact details for me. Thanks for reading!
