This is the first in a five part series centered around the [Learning How To
Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/) course, available as a free MOOC on Coursera. I've always been interested
in how to optimise the learning process; the Data Science profession is built on
very quickly shifting sands, so staying up to date with the latest advancements
in the field is highly important for any professional working in the space.
There will be four posts (synthesizing the learning from each week of the
course), along with a final shorter post that reviews the course as a whole.

I first saw recommendations for the course on Hacker News; the timing was
serendipitous as it fell in with a particularly quiet period at work, during the
2019 UK General Election. Purdah rules come into effect, which has two effects:

1.  Publication of work is forbidden as it may influence the election outcome.
    Thus, many analytical products become "frozen in time".
2.  The ensuing uncertainty after an election period can completely shake up the
    large projects going on at a department.

Thus, Civil Servants often use the time to catch up on their professional
development, reach out to other departments, and start new schemes. I elected to
use some of the time to complete the Learning How To Learn course, amongst other
more technically-focused learning activities.

These notes were generated from notes written by hand during the course. They
are not purely notes from the course - there are some additional notes /
connections I've made based on my own experiences and other readings in relevant
subject areas. They're not too touched up, so forgive any stylistic shifts or
typos!

## Focused & Diffused Learning {#focused-and-diffused-learning}

-   The course is accompanied by A Mind for Numbers, by Dr Barbara Oakley
-   Core to the course is the idea of two modes of Learning:
    -   Focused Mode (attention on one thing, intentional, neurons firing in close proximity)
    -   Diffuse Mode (unfocused learning mode, unintentional, strenghtening of
        neurons spread out over a wider area, connections made with existing neural connections)
-   Going back and forth between these two modes is what enables us to learn;
    both are vital for the process. Growing Neurons and connecting/strengthening
    them is key to the learning process.
-   Focused Mode is best for learning new things that are complex.
-   Diffuse Mode is best for drawing connections between ideas and concepts based
    on a neural pathway you've already developed by learning in Focused Mode.
-   It's vital to allow for enough time for learning new things, especially if the
    subject matter is difficult, because learning things too quickly (cramming)
    causes a jumble of learned information that can't be effectively sorted
    through when called upon organically (although, from experience, it can be
    good for rote memorisation of methods). Crammed information can't be
    effectively called upon in domain-invariant ways, which leads to inability to
    generalise learning experiences from one application to another.
-   This learning schism (marathon vs sprint) can be likened to muscle
    development; it takes a lot of time and continuous progressive strain to build
    muscle mass efficiently and sustainably. The brain happens to work in the same
    way, it's just less intuitive because muscle is tangible, learning is not.

    The above screenshot shows the difference between neuron interactions in
    Focused and Diffused Mode. Focused Mode clusters neurons close together, like
    a pinball machine with innumerable close-knit bumpers, so trains of thought
    activate multiple "bumpers" in close proximity. Diffused mode spaces neurons
    out further apart from one another; trains of thought bounce across wide areas
    in the brain, connecting neurons in different areas together.


## Procrastination, Memory & Sleep {#procrastination-memory-and-sleep}

-   The author hated Maths & Science as a child, but this was changed as she got older.
-   Key to this was her tendency to always procrastinate with anything Maths
    related. The procrastination process is started when people have a task
    that's making them anxious/unhappy lingering over them. When this happens, the
    brain tries to rectify the problem by shifting focus and distracting the
    person to something easy, like browsing Twitter/Reddit. Junk Food for the brain.
-   The Pomodoro Method (25 minutes focused / 5 minutes rest) helps break the
    brain out of this cycle because of the small chunks of focused learning, which
    happens to be around the amount of time in which we can remain completely in
    Focused Mode without performance loss. Then, the 5 minute chunk allows the
    Diffuse Mode to take over and solidify the learned material.


### Memory {#memory}

-   There are two types of Memory:
    -   Long Term Memory (like a warehouse, sometimes slow to search, less specific,
        but absolutely massive)
    -   Working Memory (approximately 4 chunks of information can be cotained within
        it, like a blackboard with limited space & disappearing chalk).
-   To get information from working to long term memory, repetition is required
    over time.
-   This is how Spaced Repetition works; it's the most efficient way to move
    chunks of information from working to long term memory.
-   Trying to cram information without leaving adequate time / diffusion mode
    learning is a bit like trying to lay bricks before the mortar is dry - the
    information will end up cluttered, messy, and fragile.


### Sleep {#sleep}

-   Sleep is vital for learning because it clears out blockers for learning in the
    form of melatonin/cortisol imbalances in the brain. It also acts a session
    during which the brain can sort through its Working/Short Term memory cache
    and clear out unnecessary information. It replays practiced material through
    the mind, strengthening the most important neuronal connections, while
    clipping unnecessary ones. These different processes happen during different
    stages of sleep (see Why We Sleep by Dr Matthew Walker, very interesting book
    if a bit prone to overlabouring the point).


## Interview with Dr Terrence Sejnowski {#interview-with-dr-terrence-sejnowski}

Terrence is one of the world's leading Neuroscientists. Here are some tips from
him regarding his learning process.

1.  Boring stuff will always be boring, but you should be concerned if the
    subject matter is interesting but you're not engaging. If it's a problem with
    the delivery, you can ask a question and it will help refocus things.
2.  Physical Activity is the most optimal Diffuse Learning Mode activator,
    because it causes the brain to grow new neurons and increases their
    connectivity.
3.  Multitasking isn't actually doing two things at once, it's almost impossible
    to do things truly in tandem. Our brains are serial processor machines.
    Multitasking is more about one's ability to switch contexts, and when in a
    busy, distractive environment it's an important skill to work on.
4.  Neurons in the brain's cortex are there from birth, but neurons in the
    Hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for learning and memory, are
    constantly regenerating. The connectivity of new neurons is influenced by the
    environment the person is in; stimulating environments (in terms of being
    around other people, interesting places, etc) can increase neural
    connectivity by a factor of 2.
5.  This is why Creative Thinking happens more effectively in the presence of
    others. Interacting with others by bouncing ideas around, challenging one
    another, etc, increases the brain's ability to think creatively on a
    neurophysical level.
6.  Persistence and Passion are more sustainable than raw talent when it comes to
    learning things. Learning areas should be picked based on those factors.
