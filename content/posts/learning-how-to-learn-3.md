This week has a dual focus.

Firstly, procrastination is examined. Why do we procrastinate when we want to do
hard tasks? It's not just learning; procrastination affects many different
everyday tasks we know we need to do but may initially be daunting. We go into
the neurological rationale behind procrastination, and learn techniques on how
to avoid it.

Secondly, we learn about memory formation and access. Included are techniques
for building chunks using memory tricks, and how memories work in the brain.


## Procrastination {#procrastination}

It's easier than most people think to avoid procrastination.

The reason most people in this day and age procrastinate is because of our
constant distracted states in the 21st century. We all carry around a device
with infinite possibilities for distraction, and that's just the start. We
procrastinate because, when faced with an undesirable task, our brain wants to
divert away that negativity. It comes up with ideas of alternative things to do,
allows you to be distracted, etc. When the distractive activity happens, the
brain releases dopamine, as most distracting activities do (and are sometimes
optimised for). This creates a vicious cycle through which we become "chronic
procrastinators", as the neural pathway is reinforced. In this way,
procrastination is very similar to addiction.

A useful analogy is to think of the crazy people that used to microdose
themselves with poisons to "build up resistance". Sure enough, they could
stomach a large dose of arsenic/cyanide/what-have-you, but it was wrecking havoc
on their insides and lead to an early death in the long term. Procrastination
won't kill you, but the more procrastinating you do, the more your brain sees it
as a viable alternative to doing the work you actually need to do. Like building
up tolerance to a drug, it can become harder and harder to actually whip your
focus back on willpower alone.

A note on willpower; it's pretty much useless when you try and use it too much.
It should be viewed as a _precious resource_, limited and only to be used in
important situations sparingly. It's very fragile, made even moreso because we
often link our self-esteem to our capacity for willpower. It has its place in
destroying the procrastination habit, when used sparingly. More on that later.


### The Procrastination Habit {#the-procrastination-habit}

Procrastination is ultimately a habit. We all know how hard to kick they can be.
Habit formation works similarly to chunking; creation of new chunks requires
conscious processing of input data to your brain. Through practice, you go from
processing that data in your conscious mind to your subconscious mind.
Eventually, you don't even consider finer details of whatever chunk you've
created unless you need to; you have a subconscious understanding of the chunk's
subject matter as a whole. Examples include riding a bike, backing out of a
driveway, or executing a maneuver in the martial arts (see Josh Waitzkin's Art
of Learning for an excellent book all about this). Habit formation works in the
same way; initially conscious, leading to subconscious execution without even
thinking about it.

It can be helpful to think of your subconscious mind as your inner "zombie"
army. They don't really process input data deliberately; they rely on ingrained
knowledge through practiced chunking, or habits you've formed over time.


#### Structure of a Habit {#structure-of-a-habit}

There are four stages to a habit.

1.  **Cue**: An event that triggers the habit.
2.  **Routine**: The response made by your inner zombie in response to the cue.
3.  **Reward**: Dopamine-releasing response when the routine is completed.
4.  **Belief**: Our mental rationale to keep a habit going; believing it's
    beneficial, or that you're physically unable to kick said habit.

Crucially, habits are perpetuated through the final **Belief** stage of the habit.
We often rationalise our habits. An example of rationale for procrastinating is
"I'll eventually burn out if I don't let my hair down for a minute". How do we
avoid this pattern of thinking?


### Process vs Product {#process-vs-product}

First of all, don't kick yourself for feeling negative about learning activities
at their outset. Our hunter-gatherer brains work against us here; it's a
perfectly natural human response to tough, brain-intensive tasks. It's not
actually this negativity that triggers the bad habit formation though; it's your
response to it that matters more.

This is where the distinction between Process and Product comes in to things.
The brain triggers negative, procrastination-breeding feelings when confronted
by thoughts of a deliverable; the **product**. Instead, focusing on the **learning
process** will help trigger a much more beneficial mental state for productive
work.

-   Process: "I will work for 25 minutes on that important analysis".
-   Product: "I need to finish this important analysis for XYZ".

What quote puts you in a more anxious mental state? Focusing on the **process**
is a much more sustainable way to approach challenging activities; not just
learning. This is why the Pomodoro method is so useful; by blending in 25 minute
work periods with 5 minute breaks, and focusing on the process of that work
rather than the product of it, you remain optimally focused _and_ avoid
procrastination. This is how we build better work habits.

The brain also prefers process over product. By overloading our working memory
with thoughts of a large deliverable we can get anxious and procrastinate by
doing simpler work (or no work at all). When focusing on process, we can filter
away distractions more easily because our subconscious brain knows it's time for
work; rather than giving in to the distraction under the rationale that we'll
get "right back to it" after the distraction is complete.


### Mobilising your inner zombie army: Beating Bad Habits {#mobilising-your-inner-zombie-army-beating-bad-habits}

The **cue** is the first stage of the habit. It's what leads you to generate the
bad habit in the first place, and what triggers the response. For
procrastination, the trigger might be something like a colleague discussion you
can overhear in the kitchen that you want to join, or glancing over a
particularly enticing bookmark to your favourite infotainment platform.

Common cue types are:

-   Location
-   Time
-   Sensory Stimuli (Emotional/Physical)
-   Reactions

Now we know what the first stage of a habit is, we can attack our
procrastination at the source; the cue. You can't avoid the cues. We don't live
in sensory deprivation chambers. But we _can_ control our response to the cue.
We can do this by enacting a **plan** when we notice the cue. When noticing a
whatsapp message pop up from your group chat, follow a _plan_ you've determined
to put your phone in your bag for a while instead of opening it up and
responding immediately. By enacting and sticking to plans, you're replacing the
routine part of the habit with something better; starting the process of
building good habits in place of bad ones. It also avoids the willpower issue;
you aren't using willpower to pull your attention away from your zombies
screaming at you to perform the Routine response to the cue, you're just doing a
different Routine response instead.

When things go right, you should reward yourself. This also helps in the setting
of more positive habits. At the end of particularly productive pomodoro
intervals (if you decide to use them), grab a snack to get that surefire
dopamine & serotonin kick. Build up that zombie army in favour of your new
positive work habits. Be the pavlovian dog! After a while, you may enter a
flow-state, where we feel in a positive mood due to breakthroughs you make as
you progress through your learning material (the understanding gained from new
chunk formation is very motivating). This creates a positive feedback loop,
which we always want to maximise our exposure to!

Finally, you need to believe in your new habits. A good tip is to engage with
communities of like-minded individuals who are all motivated to do what you're
doing, whether that's learning, or using a technology, whatever. This belief
replaces your old beliefs in your procrastination habit being unchangeable and
inevitable, even if you're "faking it" at first. It's still neurologically
powerful.

The process for developing good habits is ultimately the same as the process for
reversing bad habits. You just need to overwrite your trigger response to a cue
shared with a bad habit with a good one. This is how we overcome
procrastination. By enacting your plan, rewarding yourself and building
confidence in your better habits, your bad habits are minimised.


### Juggling Life & Learning {#juggling-life-and-learning}

Task lists are _really_ common. But did you know that by setting them at the
very end of a day (before you go to bed), your subconscious mind, your _zombie
army_, processes a lot of the cognitive load you would otherwise have swirling
around your conscious mind in your working memory? Your zombies will help
process that information, in ways that you aren't even aware of, to help you
perform better.

Initially, it's really hard to estimate how long it takes to do something. I
always wondered how people were able to accurately estimate how long it would
take to learn a certain amount of material, or perform a task at the beginning
of my career. As you learn more about a certain problem area, and more generally
as you get older, you get better at estimating how long it takes to complete
things. This is vital for good planning, as it enables you to appropriately plan
time and stop you getting overwhelmed.

Setting a quitting time is just as important as scheduling in learning time. The
reason for this is that you don't just harm your ability to work at your best by
overlearning (see the distinction between cramming and learning over time in
[my notes for Week 1]({{< relref "learning-how-to-learn-1" >}}). By handing the day's material over to your diffuse mode,
you solidify your learning experiences, which is a vital step in creating any
real understanding about a subject, rather than disparate learned facts and methods.

One last tip for this section; how does one _swallow a frog?_ Swallowing the
Frog is the concept of doing the most difficult task on the day's docket first
to minimise cognitive load, dread and procrastination. Don't fool yourself into
thinking that doing busy-work is productive when you have the most pressing/most
difficult/most **undesirable** task still staring you in the face. Swallow the
frog, get it out of the way, be happy.


## Memory {#memory}

I'll be straight with you. The human brain _sucks_ for remembering facts,
figures, words, code. I mentioned how the brain didn't really evolve to cope
with distraction very well, because not too long ago an ignored distraction
could get us killed. When was the last time a hungry lion stopped its prey
and asked what year England won the World Cup?

However, our brains are incredible at managing sensory, visual and spatial
information. We store that type of information into memory extremely
efficiently. I often catch myself humming a song I remember from a long time
ago, but I realise I don't remember its name. We can often recognise where we
are based on the look of the landscape around you.

The more senses you are able to hook into things you need to remember, the
stronger the memories of that information will be. This, combined with
repetition, is what facilitates the movement of information from working to
long-term memory. This is also the reason why handwriting, rather than just
visually and audibly processing information, helps solidify learning. All these
lecture notes are adapted from short handwritten notes I make watching the
course videos.


### What is Long Term Memory? {#what-is-long-term-memory}

Long term memory of newly learned material is directed by the hippocampus.
Individuals without a hippocampus in their brain (removed through surgery for
epilepsy for instance) suffer from chronic amnesia. A sense for what this is
like can be gained by watching the film [Memento, by Christopher Nolan](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144/). They may
have memories, but they struggle to develop new ones.

Memories are not static objects. They aren't just committed to memory and left
there permanently unchanged. Committal of memories is called **consolidation**.
Every subsequent access of a memory alters it, through a process called
**reconsolidation**. The below image is a schematic map of what this process looks
like. Reconsolidation happens all the time, even through sleep.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/memoryconsolidation.png" >}}

Neurologically, this may be linked to the presence of **astrocytes** in the brain.
Astrocytes are a type of glial cell, which is a cell type that supports neurons
in the brain. They provide nutrients, maintain ion balance, amongst other
functions. The key finding from postmortem investigation of Einstein's brain,
performed to see what enabled him to think so creatively in such a technical
field, found that he had a significantly elevated astrocyte count compared to
the typical human; aside from that it was a completely normal brain. Further
research shows that transplanted human astrocytes implanted into mice
significantly increased their ability to solve puzzles. Make of that what you
will. The image below shows Astrocytes in green and Neurons in blue.

### Creating Memories {#creating-memories}

This section goes into understanding some techniques for creating memories more solidly.

Firstly, note that memories are formed much more strongly when organised into
meaningful groups. It's easier to remember three separate events that happened
on the same date when you group these events in your mind under that date, for
instance.

One memory trick to help facilitate chunk formation and committal of information
into long term memory is the **Mnemonic**. The following mnemonic is for the
Electromagnetic Spectrum:

> **R** oman ~ **M** en ~ **In** vented ~ **V** ery ~ **U** nusual ~ **X** Ray ~ **G** uns

Radio Wave, Micro Wave, Infrared, Visible Light, Ultraviolet, X-Ray, Gamma Wave
respectively. Imagining a bunch of centurions running around blasting each other
with X-Ray guns is an absurd concept but linking the mnemonic to learn the names
(and wavelength order) of the spectrum is useful when first developing the
chunk, and can be discarded when the information is fully chunked in my mind.

Another technique is the **Memory Palace**. This memory trick works by visualising a
familiar place, and assigning objects like furniture and wallpaper to pieces of
disparate information that you want to group together "artificially". It is
possible to memorise the full order of a deck of cards with just a small bit of
practice using this technique.

Many people turn their noses up at these techniques. A common cause of complaint
is that by creating artificial groupings to commit information to long term
memory, you are not "properly" learning the material, whatever that means.
However, research shows that those who use these techniques:

-   Outperform those who don't when tested on the subject matter.
-   Form chunks more readily and easily.
-   Create big picture templates to generalise chunks from more easily.
-   Use the learned material more creatively.

This is why mnemonics are so ubiquitous in language learning. By injecting wild
neural connections through absurd, silly, wacky when forming chunks _right from
the beginning_, you're laying the groundwork for your diffuse mode to more
readily make links to other chunks. Creative neural links are formed. This is
extremely important, as creativity helps you harness information in natural,
spontaneous ways, so your understanding is much _deeper_ than it otherwise would
have been.


## Summing Up {#summing-up}

The key takeaways from this week's learning are as follows:


### Procrastination {#procrastination}

-   Procrastination is entirely manageable through the formation of better work habits.
-   The first way to do this is to recognise your procrastination cues, which is
    often focusing too hard on the end-goal when embarking on a task. Focusing on
    the process is much healthier for the mind.
-   Rewarding yourself during the creation of better habits helps overwrite bad
    habits. Replacing the response to a cue is the key. Belief in your new, better
    habits is the final step to ensure they remain intact.
-   Willpower isn't necessary if you make sure that you have a backup plan for
    potential distraction cues. If it must be used, make sure it's used
    _sparingly_ as it's a fragile, finite resource.
-   Habit formation is very similar to chunk formation; it's all about committing
    information into long-term memory in ways that you can process subconsciously
    (using your zombie army).
-   Ensure your plans and todos are sacrosanct, especially in the early stages of
    overwriting procrastination habits with better work habits. _Eat your frogs_
    by doing the work you dread the most first.


### Memory {#memory}

-   Memories aren't static. They're neurological objects that are subject to
    change, even when we aren't necessarily aware that we're processing those
    memories. This has positive and negative effects.
-   Human memory is not optimised for learning _knowledge-based_ material. It is
    optimised for sensory and spatial knowledge. Employing certain techniques
    (_memory tricks_ like mnemonics and memory palaces) to exploit these helps
    commit information to long term memory more easily.
-   Memory tricks aren't to be sniffed at; as they often incorporate additional
    information into the learning of new material, you will understand the
    material on a deeper level and utilise it more creatively once that
    understanding is formed, despite the idea seeming counterintuitive at first.
