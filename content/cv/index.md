# Work Experience

## 2020-20xx

**Lead Data Scientist**: HM Treasury

In February 2020, I was transferred to the UK's Finance and Economics Ministry to
introduce Data Science methods to its policymaking process for the first time.
Utilising skills in Data Engineering, Data Science and Leadership, I have
quickly ended up key to the department's analytical strategy for the COVID-19
pandemic; setting the department's strategy for the adoption of Data Science as
an analytical discipline, leading projects designed to bolster the evidence base
for government support schemes, and coordinating colleagues from other
government departments to ensure efficient project delivery under extreme time
constraints.

## 2019-2020

**Data Science Team Leader**: Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy

I previously led a team of Data Scientists working in Rapid Response and
advanced techniques at the department. I was the senior official in charge of
high-profile projects involving up to 6 other data scientists working
concurrently. These research projects could involve anything from backend
engineering to transfer learning NLP tasks; the remit was to push the envelope
on what was possible using Data Science in short delivery timescales. I also
used my software engineering skills to modernise the team's Data Science
process.

One of my research projects was significant enough to land me in front of the
20 most senior government officials in the country, including the Cabinet
Secretary at the time, Mark Sedwill.

## 2018-2019

**Data Scientist**: Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy

I moved to BEIS to work in their Data Science team, particularly on EU Exit
Analysis and Rapid Response projects for ministers and the Permanent
Secretary. My projects were heavily focused on NLP, Dataset Creation &
Webscraping, Interactive Reporting and Classification models.

## 2017-2018

**Data Scientist**: Food Standards Agency

I joined the Civil Service Fast Stream and was placed at the Food Standards
Agency. I developed the Data Science capability at the department.

My projects included world trade visualisation, and predicting Norovirus
frequencies as a function of Tweets with >80% accuracy.

## 2015-2017

**Consultant**: InfoCat Ltd.

My role was to design, build and integrate financial systems. I worked in a wide
variety of sectors, including Investment Banking, FMCG, Charity, Travel and
Aerospace firms.

I learned a wide range of Data Engineering skills, as the most challenging parts
of the role were gluing different systems together in an efficient way. Unlike
most consultancies, we had a reputation for our focus on resilience - I learned
how to write fantastic documentation and robust software here.


# Education

## 2011-2015:

**MSci Mathematics (Geophysical and Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics)**: First Class

Research-focused Masters intended to prepare students for PhD study. My research
was in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (cyclone modelling).

My taught courses were a fairly even mix of Calculus, Dynamical Systems, Climate
Science and Linear Algebra. Details on these courses, and my marks on them, are
available in my degree transcript on request.


# Skills

## Technical

### Python 

I am an expert Python user for all data tasks. I have used it for ETL/Data
Pipelines, Deep Learning, Web Applications, NLP and Package Development.

### R

I am an expert R user. I have used it mostly for visualisations, ETL,
statistical modelling, forecasting and interactive reports. I have no preference
for either Python nor R generally speaking; I am language agnostic and use the
best tool for the job given the wider circumstances of the project.

### SQL

I use SQL to write performant ETL production code. I have used both traditional
row-indexed DBs like SQLite, Postgres & SQL Server, and columnar DBs like DuckDB
and BigQuery for analytics workloads, both in production.

### Git

I am an advanced Git user. I use Magit to manage my repositories. I also
implement QA processes in my teams in part with a branch + PR workflow.

### Spark

I have used Spark (via the PySpark API) to filter and aggregate large datasets
held within a Data Lake on our production cloud infrastructure.

### Docker

I have deployed Web Applications, APIs and Python simulation models using Docker on
government cloud infrastructure.

### Automation - Shell & Airflow

I regularly use the shell (bash) to automate small scale tasks without
interdependencies. I use Airflow DAGs to automate larger scale tasks, with more
complex dependencies (eg: Data Pipelines). 

### Linux

I am comfortable using UNIX-based OSes both via SSH and with a Desktop
Environment. My favoured development environment is Ubuntu with Emacs, which I
make work either with native linux or WSL2.

### LaTeX

I use LaTeX for document authoring, including this CV.

## Soft Skills

- Team Leadership & ability to set analytical strategy.
- Rigorous Learning & Development focus for myself and my team.
- Excellent communicative skills with stakeholders.
- Excellent track record of translating business needs into Data Science
  products.
- Project Management (both Agile & prescriptive methods).


# Interests

### Sports

Formula 1 & Football.

### Cooking

I primarily cook Italian, Greek, Chinese and Japanese dishes. I am also a keen
baker.

### Books

I read non-fiction primarily. Fiction books are generally Sci-Fi. My favourite
book is Musashi, by Eiji Yoshikawa, a fictionalised depiction of Miyamoto
Musashi's life.


# Projects

Here are two toy projects I have worked on in my spare time. They are not
designed to be a showcase of my technical expertise, which has mostly been built
through delivery of closed-source projects in government.

## TF-IDF String Matcher

<https://github.com/LouisTsiattalou/tfidf_matcher>

Python package providing lightning fast string matching using TF-IDF & K-NN
clustering on ngrams (default 3-grams) of strings. \\(\mathcal{O}(n\log{}n)\\)
complexity.

## Trade Data API

<https://github.com/LouisTsiattalou/TradeDataAPI>

HMRC Trade Data is extremely inaccessible in format. This project aims to
download and ingest the dirty data into a consistent and organised database,
with an API layer on top.

Current Status: ETL processes complete. Project on hold as all my time is
currently spent working on the COVID Response.
