# Work Experience


## 2019-20xx

**Data Science Team Leader**: Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy

I lead a team of Data Scientists working in Rapid Response and advanced
techniques at the department. I have lead on high-profile projects involving
up to 6 other data scientists. These frequently involve using cutting edge
techniques not used before at BEIS, and could involve anything from backend
engineering to building deep learning models.
  
One of these research projects was significant enough to land me in front of the
20 most senior government officials in the country, including the Cabinet
Secretary Mark Sedwill.

## 2018-2019

**Data Scientist**: Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy

I moved to BEIS to work in their Data Science team, particularly on EU Exit
Analysis and Rapid Response projects for ministers and the Permanent
Secretary. My projects were heavily focused on NLP, Dataset Creation &
Webscraping, Interactive Reporting and Classification models.


## 2017-2018

**Data Scientist**: Food Standards Agency

I joined the Civil Service Fast Stream and was placed at the Food Standards
Agency. I developed the Data Science capability at the department.

My projects included world trade visualisation, and predicting Norovirus
frequencies as a function of Tweets with >80% accuracy.


## 2015-2017

**Consultant**: InfoCat Ltd.

My role was to design, build and integrate financial systems. I worked in a wide
variety of sectors, including Investment Banking, FMCG, Charity, Travel and
Aerospace firms.

I learned a wide range of Data Engineering skills, as the most challenging parts
of the role were gluing different systems together in an efficient way. Unlike
most consultancies, we had a reputation for our focus on resilience - I learned
how to write fantastic documentation and robust software here.


# Education


## 2011-2015:

**MSci Mathematics (Geophysical and Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics)**: First Class

Research Focused Masters intended to prepare students for PhD study. My research
was in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics, where I created a model to track multiple
cyclones in the atmosphere using the Barotropic Vorticity Equation using Matlab,
and studied their resultant interaction modes.

My taught courses were a fairly even mix of Calculus (including fluid dynamics),
Statistics, Dynamical Systems, Climate Science and Linear Algebra.

Details on these courses, and my marks on them, are available in my degree
transcript.
